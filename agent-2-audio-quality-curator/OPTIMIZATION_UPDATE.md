# Agent 2 Update: Audio Quality Curator - ULTIMATE OPTIMIZATION

## Status
AUDIO ENGINEERING PROTOCOL - Nov 11, 2025
Professional Quality Control Framework für AI-Generated Music

## Neue Funktionalität
- Objective Audio Metrics (LUFS, TP, LRA, Frequency Balance, Stereo Imaging, SNR)
- Genre-Specific Quality Standards (Genre Reference Profiles - GRP)
- Vocal Quality Assessment (Anti-Robotic Score, Clarity, Pitch, Sibilance, Emotion)
- Music Production Quality (Mix Balance, Instrument Clarity, Production Value, Low-End, Arrangement)
- Suno-Specific AI Artifact Detection (5 Artefakt-Kategorien)
- Quality Thresholds & Readiness Gates (Gold/Standard/Problematic/Reject)
- Recommendation Engine (Regeneration + Manual Editing Strategies)
- Final Quality Score Algorithm (8-sektional gewichtet)

## Key Parameters Integrated
✅ 6 Objektive Metriken (LUFS, TP, LRA, Frequency, Phase, SNR)
✅ Genre Reference Profiles (Reggaeton, Hip-Hop/Trap, Pop)
✅ 5 Vocal Quality Sub-Metrics (Timbre, Clarity, Pitch, Sibilance, Emotion)
✅ 5 Production Quality Sub-Metrics (Balance, Separation, Value, Low-End, Arrangement)
✅ 5 AI-Specific Artifacts (Warping, Robotic, Glitches, Structural, Timing)
✅ Critical Failure Thresholds (Automatic Reject Conditions)
✅ Recommendation Matrix (Problem → Solution)
✅ FQS Algorithm (Weighted Multi-Section Formula)

## Output Quality
✅ Rigorous Technical Analysis
✅ Genre-Contextual Evaluation
✅ AI-Artifact Detection
✅ Actionable Recommendations
✅ Production-Ready Assessment
✅ JSON-Structured Report
✅ Professional Audio Engineering Standard

## Quality Score Ranges
- 85-100: GOLD STANDARD (Production Ready)
- 70-84: STANDARD (Needs Minor Work)
- 50-69: PROBLEMATIC (Re-Generation Recommended)
- 0-49: REJECT (Unusable)

## Vocal Quality Hierarchy
1. Timbre & Naturalness (30%)
2. Vocal Clarity & Intelligibility (25%)
3. Pitch Accuracy & Tuning (20%)
4. Sibilance Control (15%)
5. Emotional Performance (10%)

## AI Artifact Detection
✅ Digital Artifacts & High-Frequency Warping (Critical)
✅ Robotic Voice Artifacts (Critical)
✅ Audio Glitches & Dropouts (Critical)
✅ Structural Anomalies (High)
✅ Timing Issues / Rhythm Drift (Medium)

## Genre Reference Profiles
✅ Reggaeton (Dembow-Focus, Loud, Compressed)
✅ Hip-Hop/Trap (808-Bass, Aggressive Hi-Hats)
✅ Pop (Vocal-Forward, Polished, Balanced)

## Recommendation Strategy
- Regeneration: Parameter/Prompt Adjustments for Agent 1
- Manual Editing: Specific Tools + Techniques
- Combination: When both strategies needed

## Integration
- Quality Gate for Music Production Pipeline
- Feedback Loop to Agent 1 (Regeneration Strategies)
- Pre-Filter for Video Production (Agent 3+)
- Production-Ready Clearance

## Deployment Status
- Created: 2025-11-11
- Status: AUDIO ENGINEERING STANDARD READY FOR TRAINING
- Model: Professional Quality Control Framework
- Optimization Level: Master-Guide Integrated (Audio Engineering Best Practices)
- Region: europe-west3 (Frankfurt)
